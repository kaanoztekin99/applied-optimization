# applied-optimization
This repository contains my full collection of assignment solutions, figures, and implementation files from the Applied Optimization course.
## Notes

The solutions and implementations used in my report are shared in my github repository (linked in my report). 
All figures and scripts are organized clearly under separate folders for both **Python** and **MATLAB**.

- The `figures/` directory contains all contour and surface plots generated during the analysis.  
- The `scripts/` directory includes the full implementations for each objective function.
- Both Python and MATLAB versions are provided for **Part A**, including visualization of objective functions, feasible regions, and optimal points.
- **Part B** of the lab was completed entirely in Python, and the corresponding analytical and numerical results are included under the Python scripts section.
